# About Me  

Hi, I’m **Ravi Kiran Nukala** —  
Senior Director of Software Engineering, AI experimenter, cloud architect,  
and a lifelong learner.  

I created **Ravi Learns** to document what I learn every week across:  

- AI & LLMs  
- Engineering leadership  
- Software architecture  
- Data & integrations  
- DevOps & cloud  
- Personal projects and experiments  

This is my continuous-learning journal — sharing knowledge, improving daily,  
and building in public.  

Thanks for visiting!
