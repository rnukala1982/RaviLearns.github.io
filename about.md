Hi, I'm **Ravi Kiran Nukala** — Senior Director of Software Engineering, AI experimenter, cloud architect, and lifelong learner based in Hayward, California. I created **Ravi Learns** to document what I learn every week across:  
- AI & LLMs  
- Engineering leadership  
- Software architecture  
- Data & integrations  
- DevOps & cloud  
- Personal projects and experiments  
  
In my career, I've led global engineering teams to build scalable SaaS platforms and drive innovation in AI and cloud technologies. I enjoy exploring agentic workflows, building tools like DreamNestAI, and sharing insights on architecture, leadership, and technology.  
  
This site is my continuous-learning journal — sharing knowledge, improving daily, and building in public. Thanks for visiting!
