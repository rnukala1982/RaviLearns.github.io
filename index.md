# Welcome to Ravi Learns  
![Ravi Kiran Nukala](1687272439882.jpeg)  

This is my personal space where I document learnings and insights from my work in technology, engineering leadership, AI, platform architecture, and software development. I write about the challenges I encounter, the solutions I discover, and the experiments that shape my perspective as both a builder and a leader.
